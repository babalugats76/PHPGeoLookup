#Summary

This project shows you how to create a simple geo lookup form using PHP.  The form performs a "lookup" of a user's IP address using a publically-available web service, http://www.geoplugin.com/, to obtain geographic information, e.g., area code, city, country, etc.   

#What you will learn

You will learn how PHP can be used to perform powerful, useful tasks.  In particular, how PHP can use web services to provide rich data to the web applications you build.
